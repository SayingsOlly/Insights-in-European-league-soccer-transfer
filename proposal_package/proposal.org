* Motivation
Enjoying watching the European soccer league games, we want to visualize data about soccer to show the trend of soccer's development.
Since there have been many research about the outcome of games, we decide to exploring our data from another perspective:
the transfer market which reflects not only the loyalty of players but also the development of leagues or teams. Our topic is the European league soccer transfer,
related to the number of players transfer both within and among leagues as well as the rank of players who has the most number of transfer times.

* Project Objectives
1. How many players transferd between teams within a league in each year.
2. How many players transferd between leagues in each year.
3. The trend of the number of transferd players among leagues.
4. The rank of players who has the most number of transfer times.
* Data

Our data is from Kaggle European Soccer Database, and the link is /[[https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer][here]]/.\\
\\
The data we want to use has 11 European league, more than 25000 matches and at least 10000 players from season 2008 to season 2016.\\
\\
The form of data set is several tables in sqlite database, so we plan to join the tables to get which player belongs to which team from year to year, then we can know the trasfer of players.\\
